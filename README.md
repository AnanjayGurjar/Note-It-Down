# Note-It-Down
## Yet another notes app, why?
- This is a frontend app for my own created [Notes backend app](https://github.com/AnanjayGurjar/NotesBackendApp) hence created my first standalone
- Motive was to learn lot new concepts and best practices through this which otherwise I would procastinate such as:
  - Dependency Injection using dagger and hilt
  - followed complete mvvm architecture with single activity
  - Used response class to handle the response from the api
  - Learned more about OkHttp interceptor and token passing
  - Implemented ListAdapter for recycler view using DiffUtil
  - Finally writing a readme.md file
 
## Future plans for the app
- Add undo delete option
- Apply offline caching with room support
- migrate project to jetpack compose
